 # AIOCRUD

This project contains CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods for supported databases. If your database of choice is not supported, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or contribute to the code yourself.

## Installation

To install the AIOCRUD package, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install aiocrud
```

## Usage

To use AIOCRUD, first import the `CRUDFactory` class from the `db_type` module. Then, call the `create_crud` method on the `CRUDFactory` class, passing in the name of the database you want to use. For example, to create a PostgreSQL CRUD object, you would use the following code:

```
from db_type import CRUDFactory

crud = CRUDFactory.create_crud("postgresql")
```

Once you have created a CRUD object, you can use it to perform CRUD operations on the database. The following code snippets show how to perform each of the CRUD operations:

### Create

To create a new record in the database, use the `create` method on the CRUD object. The `create` method takes two arguments: the name of the table you want to insert the data into, and a tuple of data values. For example, the following code snippet shows how to insert a new record into the `employees` table:

```
employees_data = (
    "John", "Doe", "john@example.com", "555-1234", "123 Main St", "CityA", "StateA", "12345", random.uniform(30000, 80000)
)

crud.create("employees", 
            ("first_name", employee_data[0]),
            ("last_name", employee_data[1]),
            ("email", employee_data[2]),
            ("phone", employee_data[3]),
            ("address", employee_data[4]),
            ("city", employee_data[5]),
            ("state", employee_data[6]),
            ("postal_code", employee_data[7]),
            ("salary", employee_data[8])
           )
```

### Read

To read data from the database, use the `read` method on the CRUD object. The `read` method takes two arguments: the name of the table you
